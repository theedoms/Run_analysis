Project of Coursera Datascience specialization module "Gettig and Cleaning Data"

This project aims at gathering and summarizing data from a few files containing sensor values.

The project describing the experiment is located at 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

After data is gathered and cleaned, it is analyzed and a summary table with averages of relevant data is created with write.table(). This file name is new_dataset.txt


The different steps of this process are described in the file CodeBook.Rmd
